                        Here at Haws, a special moment in history transpired when Luther Haws invented the drinking fountain in 1906. Along with this special moment in history, there are interesting happenings that go along
                         with the early invention of drinking fountains. Here are 5 kooky moments in history regarding drinking fountains that you may not have known.Among the biggest supporters of drinking fountains were temperance groups, who thought they would discourage people from drinking so much alcohol. Temperance groups were among the wealthy in the earthy 19th century. Temperance groups supported the drinking fountain movement by funding the building  of more drinking fountains.
                        Around 1920, settled power  on water fountains= with slanted jets of water as the safest, most sensible format and they’ve remained pretty similar ever since.

                    <h2>What is the oldest fountain in the world?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        AN EARLY example of a fountain, found in Mesopotamia, dates from around 3000 BC. It consisted of a series of basins which made use of a natural spring.
                        A similar system is found in Greek and Roman remains. Mechanically-operated fountains became familiar during the 15th century in Italy. (Source: The Origins Of Everything, by Gordon Grimley, 1973.)
                        INTEREST in the use of water in the new grand gardens of 16th- and 17th-century Italy is attributed by Simon Schama (Landscape and Memory, 1995) to the publication in Venice in 1499 of The Dream Of Poliphilus by Francesco Colonna. 
                        He drew on classical and pagan tradition to develop a mythical world in which water in general, and fountains in particular, played an important role.

                    <h2>Why are fountains called fountains?</h2>

                    <p>
                        A fountain, from the Latin "fons" (genitive "fontis"), meaning source or spring,
                        is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. It is also a structure that jets water
                        into
                        the air for a decorative or dramatic effect.Fountains were originally purely functional, connected to springs or aqueducts and used to provide
                        drinking water and water for bathing and washing to the residents of cities, towns and villages. 
                        Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air.
                        A fountain symbolizes life, truth, change, and water. Fountains and water sources have played an important role in the history and are essential to life.
                        Even water itself is the symbol of purification.

                    <h2>Where was the first fountain made?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The first fountain didn’t look like what we would think of a fountain. The earliest known fountain 
                        was a carved stone basin that held precious drinking and religious, ceremonial water. This stone basin is believed to be from around 2000 BC.An early example of a fountain, found in Mesopotamia, dates from around 3000 BC.
                       It consisted of a series of basins which made use of a natural spring. The first fountain goes back to 3000 B.C; it was a goddess holding a basin. Water was sourced from a local spring. Early fountains used gravity instead of mechanical pumps to move the water. 
                       If the water sources were located at a higher elevation, the water would naturally flow downwards and out of the fountain spigot.A similar system
                       is found in Greek and Roman remains.The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water 140 metres (460 ft) in the air.
