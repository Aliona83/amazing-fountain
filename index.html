                        The modern drinking fountain was invented and manufactured in the early
                        1900s by two men: Halsey Willard Taylor with the Halsey Taylor Company;
                        and Luther Haws with the Haws Sanitary Drinking Faucet Co. These two
                        companies changed how water was served in public places.

                        A fountain, from the Latin "fons" (genitive "fontis"), meaning source or spring,
                        is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water. It is also a structure that jets water
                        into
                        the air for a decorative or dramatic effect.

                        It consisted of a series of basins which made use of a natural spring. A similar system
                        is found in Greek and Roman remains
